# ExerciseHRCodePackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ExerciseHRCode provides an easy way to analyze exercise heart rate data from Polar for the purpose of:

  1) Increasing scientific rigor, reproducibility, and transparency when reporting exercise-based research
  2) Promoting reaching target exercise intensities in research and clinical practice
  
With ExerciseHRCode, the user selects whether they want mean, maximum, and minimum heart rate response reported in 15, 30, 45, or 60 second bins. This information will be provided in an excel output file which also show total time spent in the target intensity zone. 

The user is asked to select: 1) Whether the exercise intensity is light, moderate, or vigorous, and 2) How maximal heart rate should be determined. Maximal heart rate can be determined by either 1) Entering a predetermined maximal heart rate, or 2) Selecting a predetermined equation to predict maximal heart rate. If an equation is selected, the user will be asked to enter any relevant information such as age and resting heart rate.

After completing the selection process in the console, the user will be provided with the maximum heart rate and heart rate intensity range. Two files will be exported to the output_folder filepath. One file will be a summarized_data CSV file with heart rate analyzed for each bin and total time spent in the intensity zone provided. The other file will be a JPG graph of the heart rate response during exercise with the target intensity zone highlighted. The JPG graph can be a black and white publication-ready graph or a color graph depending on what is prespecified in the code, i.e., publication_graph = TRUE or publication_graph = FALSE.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ExerciseHRCodePackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("briabartsch/ExerciseHRCode")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to run the code:

```{r example}

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
